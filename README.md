Ever since we announced the Contentful Community edition, the Contentful DevRel team has been hard at work collecting your questions with our AMA, celebrating your projects with custom swag and making it easy to learn GraphQL with our new course. To wrap up our GraphQL-focused summer, weâ€™re announcing a series of livestreams to showcase all of the amazing things that you can do with Contentful and GraphQL. We'll be building something together on Youtube and then commiting the code to this repo so you can check it out!

For our [first session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUWFiEuZmw8&feature=youtu.be) we learned about GraphQL, created some Content Models, added content and pulled it all into our new React App. Next time we'll learn about RichText.

Want to see us build something specfic, let us know and we'll make it together on stream.
